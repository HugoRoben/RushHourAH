# Rush Hour

## Introduction
RushHourAH is a Python-based solver for the Rush Hour puzzle game. This project aims to implement and compare various algorithms to find solutions for different configurations of the Rush Hour game, a popular sliding block puzzle. Users can execute the solver with different algorithms, visualize the results, and analyze performance metrics. The primary objective is to move vehicles in a grid to free the red blocked vehicle and lead it to the exit by taking the least amount of steps.

## Description


## Installation
To install RushHourAH, follow these steps:
```bash
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
git clone [https://github.com/HugoRoben/RushHourAH.git]
cd RushHourAH
2. Install the required libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Requirements
- Each experiment is run using a Macbook Pro 13 inch 
- Python 3
- Libraries: `tqdm`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `pygame` (See `requirements.txt` for more details)

### Executing program

## Usage
The project can be run from the command line. Here are some example commands:
```bash
python main.py [file_type] [algorithm] [additional options]
Replace [file_type] with csv or txt, [algorithm] with the chosen algorithm (e.g., Astar, IDDFS, BFS, Random), and include any additional options as needed, such as the dimension of the board or the amount of iterations needed to solve the puzzle.
- Run BFS algorithm for a specific range of games from the txt file:
python main.py txt bfs --game_range '0-2'
- Run A* algorithm for a single game from the txt file:
python main.py txt Astar --single_game 1
- Repeat a game multiple times using the Random algorithm:
python main.py txt Random --single_game 1 --repeat 10

Commands used to print the results of each algorithm on the 6x6_3 board. (The random algorithms give incosistent results at each experiment so we repeat the experiment and use the mean value of the results):
- python3 main.py csv random --dimension 6 --board 3 --repeat 1000
- python3 main.py csv bfs --dimension 6 --board 3
- python3 main.py csv iddfs --dimension 6 --board 3
- python3 main.py csv astar --dimension 6 --board 3

We do the same for the 9x9_4 board and the 12x12_7 board, by replacing the  --dimension 6 --board 3 parts with  --dimension 9 --board 4 and  --dimension 12 --board 7 respectively.

Example commands on the bfs algorithm:
- python3 main.py txt bfs --game_range '0-2'
- python3 main.py txt bfs --single_game 1
- python3 main.py txt bfs --single_game 1 --repeat 2
- python3 main.py txt bfs --all_games
- python3 main.py txt bfs --single_game 1 --repeat 10
- python3 main.py txt bfs --all_games --repeat 5
- python3 main.py csv bfs --dimension 6 --board 3
- python3 main.py csv bfs --dimension 6 --board 3 --repeat 5
```

## Features
- Multiple solving algorithms: A*, IDDFS, BFS, Random.
- Support for different game board dimensions.
- Repeat execution for statistical analysis.
- Visualization of solving process and results.
- Performance metrics and statistics
